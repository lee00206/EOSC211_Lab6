# EOSC211_Lab6
This is a part of the labs in Earth and Ocean Science 211 course at UBC.<br>
Lab 6 calculates runmean and it plots a graph of a time series of temperatures at Sand Heads.<br><br>
**Running Mean** (adopted from EOSC211 week 6 lab instruction): <br>
"Imagine that *N* data points are recorded hourly and number them 1, 2, 3, ..., *i* - 1, *i*, *i* +1, ..., *N* as they appear in a vector. If we are calculating a 5 point running mean, then the 5th point in the smoothed time series will be the average of points 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 from the original time series. The 6th point in the smoothed time series will be the average of points 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 from the original time series. The 7th point will be the average of points 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. And so on, moving over one point each time, with your window running through the time series, calculating the average of the points in the window at each point in the original series."<br>
